# PGAS-based Scalable Communication Library ACP, and it's Applications


## ACP (Advanced Communication Primitives): a PGAS-based Communication Library

ACP supports a communication model that transfers data via "Global Memory", that is a virtual memory space managed by the library. Each process can expose a region of its local memory to other processes by registering that region to the global memory.
